	 *     by the difference in the exponent bias (see above).
	 *   - Then we multiply the single-precision result of exponent adjustment by 2**(-112) to reverse the effect of
	 *     exponent adjustment by 0xE0 less the necessary exponent adjustment by 0x70 due to difference in exponent bias.
	 *     The floating-point multiplication hardware would ensure than Inf and NaN would retain their value on at least
	 *     partially IEEE754-compliant implementations.

	 *    FP16 = mantissa * 2**(-24).
	 * The trick is to construct a normalized single-precision number with the same mantissa and thehalf-precision input
